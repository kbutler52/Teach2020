the if statement alone tells us that if a condtion is true it will
execute a block of statement and if the condition is false it won't.
But what if we wnat to do something else if the condtion is false?
Here comes the else statement. We can ise the else statement with if
statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.

Syntax:

if ( condition):
    #Execute this block if
    #condition is true
else:
    #Execute this block if
    #condition is false

if/else example:

#python program to issustrate If else statement
#!/usr/bin/python

i=20;
if (i<15):
    print("i is smaller that 15")
    print("i'm in if block")
else:
    print("i is greater that 15")
    print("I'm in else block")
print("i'm not in if and not in else block")
