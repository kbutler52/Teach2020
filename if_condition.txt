if Statement 05-09-2020
if Statement is the most simple decision making statement.
It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statement
will be executed or not. For example if a certain condtion is true then
a block of statement is executed otherwise not.
Syntax for a if statement:
if condtion:
    #Stateement to execute if
    #condition is true


Python uses indentation to identify a block. So the block under an if statement
will be identified as shown below:

if condtion:
    statement1
statement2

#Here if the condtion is true, if block
#will consider only statement1 to be inside
#its block

#python program to illustrate If statement

i=0
if i> 10:
    print("10 is less that 15")
print("I am Not in if")
