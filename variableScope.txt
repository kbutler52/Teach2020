Variable Scope
An important concept to understand when defing a function
is the concept of variable scope.Variables defined inside a
function are treated differently that variables defined
outside. There are two main differences.

first, any variable declared inside a function is only
accessible within the function. these are known as local
variables. Any variable declared outside a function is known
as global variable and is accessible anywhere in the program.

To understand this try the code below:
message1 = "Global Variable"

def myFunction():
    print("\nINSIDE THE FUNCTION")
    #GLOBAL variables are accessible inside
    a function
    print((message1)
    #Decalaring a local variable
    message2 = "Local Variable"
    print(message2)
