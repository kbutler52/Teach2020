A function is a set of statements that take inouts,
do some specific computation and produces output.
The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done
task together and make a function, so that instead
of writing the same code again and again for diferent
inputs, we can call the funcstion.
Python provide built-in functions like print(),
etc. but we can also create your own functions.
These functions are called user-defined functions.

# a simple python function to check
#whether x is even or odd

def evenOdd(x):
    if(x%2==0):
    print"even"
else:
    print"odd"

#Driver code
evenOdd(2)
evenOdd(3)
