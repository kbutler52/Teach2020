What is a Function?
Functions are pre-written coes that perform a certain task.
We can call a function by typing the name of the function
or by using the dot notion. Some functions require us ot pass
data in for them to perform their task. These data are know as
arguments and we pass them to the function by enclosing their
values in parentheses(). separated by commas.
For instance to use the print() function for displaying text
on the screen, we call it by typing print ("Hello World")
where print is the name of the function and Hello is the argument.
On the other hand, to use replace() function for manipulating
text strings, we have to type
newString = "Hello World". replace("World, "Universe")
Where replace is the name of the function and "World" and "Universe"
are the arguments. The string before thd dot, "Hello World" is
the string that will be affected.
so "Hello World" will change to "Hello universe".
print(newString)
You will get Hello Universe
