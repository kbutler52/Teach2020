Python provides three types of loops to handle
looping requirements.  While a;; the ways provide similar
basic functionality, they differ in their syntax and condition
checking time.

The while loop:
In Python, while loop is used to execute a block of statements
repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. And when the
condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in progran
is executed.

Syntax:

while expression:
    statement(s)

    Example:
#python program to issustrate
#while loop
count = 0
    while (count < 3):
        count=count+1
        print("Hello Geek")
