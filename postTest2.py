#create a looping statement that
#prints how many pineapple you have
#reduces the numberof pineapples by 2
#repeat until pineapples is less taht 6( flexible)

#this was the answer William came up with, there are many ways to
#get the same answer

pineapples = 10
while(pineapples >=6):
    print(f"I have {pineapples} Pineapples.")
    pineapples = pineapples - 2

#use input() to store how many cherries you have into a variable called Cherries
#print how many cherries you have
#one soultion- William's solution
cherries = int(input("How many cherries do you have?"))
print("I have %d cherries" %(cherries))
