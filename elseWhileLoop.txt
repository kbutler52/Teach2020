While loop executes the block until a condition is satisfied.
When the condition becomes false, the statement immdeiately after
tje loop is executed.
The else clasue is only executed when your while condition
becomes false, it won't be executed.

If else like this:

if condition:
    #execute these statements

else
    #execute these statements

====================================
While loop like this are similar

while condition:
    #execute these statements

else:
    #execute these statements

    ==========================================
    Example:
#python program to illstrate
#combining else with while

count= 0
while(count < 3):
    count=count+1
    print("Hello Geek")
else:
    print("In Else Block")

    ==============================================
    Single statement while block:

    If the wile block consists of a single statement then
    we can declare the entire loop in a single line as shown
    below:

    #python program to illustrate
    #single statement while block

    count= 0
    while (count==0) print("Hello Geek")

    Note: It is suggested NOT to use this type of loop as it
    is a never ending infinite loop where the condition is
    always true.
